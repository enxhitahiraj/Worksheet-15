Worksheet 15 Do a Swirl tutorial in Rstudio

Open Rstudio, install the swirl package using the install.packages() function and then load the swirl package using the library() command.

Open swirl by typing swirl(). When swirl asks you what course you want to do, choose 1: R Programming. Then there will be the choice between 15 different tutorials. Pick one that looks useful to you. I would not start with the apply functions, but any other tutorial is fine.

Make notes here about the most important things you learn in the tutorial you chose:

I chose to go over the basic building blocks and it was a similar tutuorial to the online one. It was mainly just showing how to do the basic functions in R Studio.

Awesome! I hope you like swirl and come back to it later!
